- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Ziednaga!
- ğŸ‘€ I use Nobara btw.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: You can't.
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: Human or human, there's no choise.
- âš¡ Fun fact: 'Ziednaga'is a cool deformation of the Spanish word 'ciÃ©naga' which means swamp or pool of water.
- I chose this username because when PokÃ©mon Emerald I had a Linoone that had exactly that name.
